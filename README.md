# Numo::Linalg::Autoloader

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yoshoku/numo-linalg-autoloader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yoshoku/numo-linalg-autoloader)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/numo-linalg-autoloader.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/numo-linalg-autoloader)

Numo::Linalg::Autoloader is a module that has a method loading backend libraries automatically
according to an execution environment.
The library is confirmed to work with Intel MKL and OpenBLAS (installed from source)
on macOS, Ubuntu, and CentOS.
Moreover, the library currently does not support ATLAS.

If you want to set the backend library yourself,
you should refear to the [official document](https://github.com/ruby-numo/linalg/blob/master/doc/select-backend.md).

Note that the library is made for personal convenience and has no direct relationships with
the [Ruby/Numo](https://github.com/ruby-numo/numo/blob/master/README.md) project.
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors of
[Numo::NArray](https://rubygems.org/gems/numo-narray) and
[Numo::Linalg](https://rubygems.org/gems/numo-linalg).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'numo-linalg-autoloader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install numo-linalg-autoloader

## Usage

```ruby
require 'numo/linalg/autoloader'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then,
run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that
will allow you to experiment.
